# Brain-States-Analysis
This repository analyzes brain states using preprocessed fMRI NIfTI files. It extracts time series data via atlas assignments and applies K-Means clustering to identify temporal brain states. The approach is based on the methodology from Cornblath et al., exploring brain activity dynamics and cognitive modulation.
